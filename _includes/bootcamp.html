    <div class="collapsible-body"><p> Cybersecurity is an emergent landscape, one that we have wandered unguided and sometimes even misinformed. From this experience was born the endeavor to give back, to the people that aim to travel into these horizons. So we built the Hacker Wagon, a one-of-its-kind full-time residential hacking school built around the concept of community, creativity and razor focus. The only limit to a creative mind, is the lack of tools, we ARE the tool. Our hacking bootcamp is designed to immerse you into the "hacker mindset", to analyze, interpret and respond as offensive security professionals. To achieve this immersion, we decided to move away from the city, to live and breathe cybersecurity 24x7, this is why, you will be living with other aspirant minds in the quaint and peacful town: Assagao in Goa. The bootcamp is designed as a full-time residential program, where collaborative learning is encouraged. True learning is when you live, eat, and breathe the stuff, when your immersion is beyond the classroom, where the environment resonates with the same intensity as your desire to learn. Remember razor focus? This is what we're talking about! </p></div>

     <h3>Employment Opportunities</h3>
      </div>
    <div class="collapsible-body"><p>Employment of security analysts is projected to grow 32 percent over the next ten years, much faster than the average for all occupations. Demand for information security analysts is expected to be very high, as these analysts will be needed to create innovative solutions to prevent hackers from stealing critical information or disrupting computer networks. The increasing adoption of cloud services by small and medium-sized businesses and a rise in cybersecurity threats will create demand for managed security services providers in this industry. Following the completion of the course the students can start their careers by getting hired with banks, Healthcare, Govt institutions, Telecom and other major corporations. They can also have a career as bounty hunter and be self employed.</p></div>
